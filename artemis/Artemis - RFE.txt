Artemis - RFE

- Listener of the events of add/remove of an entity.

- Add a contains(Entity) to World to check if the entity is on the world or not (by checking if the uniqueid is on world, etc)

- Be aware to events of component being added/removed to/from an entity. Is this useful? in which situations?

- BUG: I believe entity delete should be processed before entity refresh/add on loopStart() method instead after.

- ComponentMapper information could be static (map between classes and types), this is not so clear. 

- Artemis system which process in each update independent of entities and components/

- Add nanotime to World to be used optionally? (if you fix your time step this should not be needed though) 

- Multiple components of the same type? restrictions to allow only one in some cases? (a workaround could be having children entities with each component)
